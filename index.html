                  Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken chunks (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce. 
                The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. 
                The dish was popularised by cooks from South Asia living in Great Britain and is offered at restaurants around the world.
                Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt 
                that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, 
                but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, 
                the only common ingredient was chicken. The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), 
                cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, 
                paprika, tomato purée or with food dye. 
                Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.
                The origin of the dish is not certain, but many sources attribute it 
                to the South Asian community in Great Britain; some sources also cite Glasgow as the city of origin.
                Chicken tikka masala may derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian subcontinent. 
                The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in Britain in the 1960s. 
                They developed and served a number of new inauthentic "Indian" dishes, including chicken tikka masala.
Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss multiple claims regarding the origin of chicken tikka masala, 
                concluding that the dish "was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef."
                They suggest that 
                "the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh’s Indian Cookery published in 1961."
                Another explanation is that it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.
                This version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, 
                invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices

In the 50s and 60s, Stroganoff saw quite a bit of popularity in the US, 
                but over time its image was marred by canned cream of mushroom soup and poor 
                cuts of meat that were slopped over noodles or rice and served in school cafeterias.

It saw so much popularity, it really became an iconic dish. Unfortunately, 
                it was this cafeteria version that everyone in the States came to associate with the name.

If you’ve been scared off by bad cafeteria versions of beef stroganoff,
                now is the time to give it another chance.
                
                The best beef to use in beef stroganoff is a cut that works well with quick cooking. 
                That means you need something that is fairly tender in its own right.
                We like to use a sirloin steak, but flank steak is another good option.

The important thing is to cut the steak into thin slices, or chunks, 
                by cutting across the grain. This shortens the fibers of the meat, 
                making it more tender with less cooking.
                The first time we made homemade stroganoff, 
                as we sat down to dinner, we were a bit in disbelief at what was sitting in front of us.

Could it be?

An elegant version of beef stroganoff?

This dish is hearty and full of flavor. With chunks of beef and ample, tender mushrooms.

And, it’s quite easy to make!

We saute our mushrooms first and then remove them from the pan. 
                This is an extra step, but it really does wonders to create different elements in the dish, 
                rather than having everything taste the same.

After the mushrooms, it’s time for the onions and beef to be sauteed.

Then, it’s time to make the gravy with beef broth and seasonings.

Sour cream gets stirred in at the end to thicken the sauce and make it extra creamy!

In less than 30 minutes, you have an incredibly comforting dish that can be served with a number of accompaniments.

sushi, 
                a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked rice flavoured with vinegar and a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw seafood garnishes and served cold. Restaurants specializing in sushi abound in Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a discriminating clientele, and the dish has gained popularity in the United States and elsewhere (see also sashimi).

Nigiri-zushi is a hand-formed oblong of rice topped with sliced raw seafood and a dab of wasabi 
                (a green paste made of true wasabi or horseradish); the ingredients of oshi-zushi are pressed 
                to shape in a mold. For maki-zushi, a sheet of nori (laver, a seaweed) is spread with rice, 
                then with seafood or vegetables and garnishes. The whole is rolled into a cylinder and sliced. 
                In chirashi-zushi, a homestyle version, the ingredients are not formed, rather the vinegared 
                rice is strewn with toppings and garnishes. 
                Vinegar-pickled ginger root (sūshoga) is a traditional palate-clearing accompaniment to sushi.
